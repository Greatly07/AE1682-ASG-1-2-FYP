(1)	Create an algorithm pseudo-code to calculate area of rectangle with following formula:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int length, width, area;
    length = 5;
    width = 3;
    area = length * width;
    
    printf("The Area of the Rectangle is %d", area);

    return 0;
}

(2)	Create an algorithm pseudo-code to calculate an area of rectangle with the same formula of previous example, with new condition where the length and width is given by user (input).
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int length, width, area;
    printf("Enter Length:\n");
    scanf("%d", &length);
    printf("Enter Width:\n");
    scanf("%d", &width);
    area = length * width;
    
    printf("The Area of the Rectangle is %d", area);

    return 0;
}
